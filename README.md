# CPE 613 Semester Project, Spring 2024
## N-Body Particle Interaction Simulation
## George Pence

### About The Project

Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force between two particles:
`F = G * (m1 * m2) / (r^2)`
F = gravitational force between the particles
G = gravitational constant
m1 and m2 = masses of the two particles
r = distance between the particles


### Getting Started
This simulation is currently hard-coded to instantiate two groups of particles - electrons and protons - for the purpose simulating hydrogen atom formation as an initial project milestone goal.

### Prerequisites
<!-- Any required libraries or other configuration the project needs to be able to run. -->

### Installation
<!-- Instructions on project setup for the audience -->
No major installation is required due to the current simple nature of the project. Simply change directory into the repository root and then run `make` to build the project executable.

### Usage
<!-- Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources. -->
Once built, execute a simulation using the following syntax:
Usage: `./sim_main.exe <num_particles_per_group> <num_steps> <delta_time>`
